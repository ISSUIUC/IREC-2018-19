# PROBLEMS TO OVERCOME
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# This is more of a notepad on problems I'm considering as I go
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# - How is combustion chamber pressure (p1) found
# - How does one find k, cp, cv, or Qr for a reaction (CEA?)
# - How do I make this an interactive type program, something that figures things
# out for itself if it needs ya know?
